## Notes

- The Google Places API has usage limits and may incur costs beyond the free tier
- If you hit rate limits, the script may fail - consider adding longer delays between requests
- The maximum radius for the Places API is 50,000 meters (50 km)

## Usage Cost Considerations

Google Places API is not free beyond a certain usage threshold:
- You get $200 equivalent credit per month (as of time of writing)
- Nearby Search requests cost $0.032 per request (first 1000 free per month)
- Place Details requests cost $0.017 per request (first 1000 free per month)

Monitor your usage in the Google Cloud Console to avoid unexpected charges.
